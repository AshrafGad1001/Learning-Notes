What is supervised and unsupervised learning in neural networks?

=>In Supervised learning, you train the machine using data which is well “labeled.” 

=>Unsupervised learning is a machine learning technique, where you do not need to supervise the model.

=>Supervised learning allows you to collect data or produce a data output from the previous experience.

What is learning in neural network differentiate between supervised learning and unsupervised learning?

=>In supervised learning, input data is provided to the model along with the output.
=>In unsupervised learning, only input data is provided to the model.
=>The goal of supervised learning is to train the model so that it can predict the output when it is given new data.



---(Is neural network supervised or unsupervised learning why?)
A neural net is said to learn supervised, if the desired output is already known.
While learning, one of the input patterns is given to the net’s input layer. 
Neural nets that learn unsupervised have no such target outputs. (It can’t be determined what the result of the learning process will look like.)


---- What is supervised and unsupervised learning with example?
Unlike supervised learning, no teacher is provided that means no training will be given to the machine.


Supervised machine learning      ===>Highly accurate.
Unsupervised machine learning    ===>Less accurate.


What is supervised learning in neural network?

Supervised learning  is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs.
A supervised learning algorithm analyzes the training data and produces an inferred function, which can be used for mapping new examples.

What is example of supervised learning?

text classification problems. 
 ==>the goal is to predict the class label of a given piece of text.
 ==>predict the felling of a piece of text, like a (tweet) or (product review).
